    github ->> githubactions: branch available
    github ->> snyk: branch available

== Checking the change ==
    activate snyk    

par Snyk and GitHub Actions check the branch
    snyk -> snyk: inspect dependencies
    loop vulnerabilities are found
        github <<-- snyk: report problems
        author <<-- github: report failure
        author ->> github: push changes to branch
        github ->> snyk: changes available
        snyk -> snyk: inspect dependencies
    end
    github <<-- snyk: report success
    deactivate snyk
    
    activate githubactions
    githubactions -> githubactions: run tests
    loop tests are failing
