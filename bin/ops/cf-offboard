Usage:

Note that you must be an OrgManager in all of the target orgs

Options:
-h:      show help and exit
user:    email address of the user
role:    name of the role to revoke
spaces:  comma-separated list of spaces where the role should be revoked
targets: comma-separated list of targets where the role should be revoked

than invoked. For example:
   DRYRUN=1 $0 someone somerole space1,space2,space3 target1,target2,target3
